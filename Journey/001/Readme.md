## DP-200 Training via esi.microsoft.com

I had the opportunity to attend DP-200 Implementing an Azure Data Solution, the instructor led training. 
In day 1 we covered the first 3 of 9 modules which were:
- Azure for the Data Engineer
- Working with Data Storage
- Enabling Team based Data Science with Azure Databricks

I'm aware that the DP-200 and DP-201 exams are being replaced with DP-203 however a lot for the content covered is still relevant and my aim with completing the course was to better understand Data Engineering and what Azure offers for Data Engineers. With DP-203 my understanding is that Azure Data Factory will feature a lot more.
