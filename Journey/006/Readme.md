# Phillip Parkinson 100DaysOfCloud[6/100]

✍️ Seeing as I started my 100DaysOfCloud journey with training I hadnt had a chance to complete the organising work, getting Github and all the daily logging sorted. Today I finally got a chance to do all of this.

Tomorrow it's back to learning and hopefully some time to create a project.
