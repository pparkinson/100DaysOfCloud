## DP-200 Training via esi.microsoft.com

I had the opportunity to attend DP-200 Implementing an Azure Data Solution, the instructor led training. 
In day 3 of DP-200 Implementing an Azure Data Solution, we covered:
- Orchestrating Data movement with Azure Data Factory
- Securing Azure Data Platforms
- Monitoring and Troubleshooting Data Storage and Processing

Today I also worked on deploying the new ABAP Developer Edition (which includes ABAP 1909 and HANA) in an Azure Container Instance.
